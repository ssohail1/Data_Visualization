## Visualize count data in R and Python
• Visualize data with absolute counts in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space
• Calculate distance metric, run PCA, and then graph data as scatter plot in Python
• Interactive graph in three-dimensional space with plotly using simulated data from rnorm
• Graphed three dimensions from pca output (three axes: x (Axis.1), y (Axis.2), z (Axis.3)) 
• Labelled data points by sample name and x, y, z coordinates
